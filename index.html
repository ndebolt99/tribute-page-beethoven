     <h3>A Timeline of Ludwig van Beethoven's life:</h3>
     <ul>
       <li><strong>1770</strong> - There is no authentic record of the date of his birth; but the registry of his baptism, in the Catholic Parish of St. Remigius on 17 December 1770, survives, and the custom in the region at the time was to carry out baptism within 24 hours of birth. There is a consensus (with which Beethoven himself agreed) that his birth date was 16 December, but no documentary proof of this</li>
       <li><strong>1780 or 1781</strong> - Beethoven began his studies with his most important teacher in Bonn, Christian Gottlob Neefe.[12] Neefe taught him composition; in March 1783 Beethoven's first published work appeared, a set of keyboard variations</li>
       <li><strong>1795</strong> - Beethoven made his public debut in Vienna over three days,[41] beginning with a performance of one of his own piano concertos on 29 March at the Burgtheater and ending with a Mozart concerto on 31 March, probably the D minor concerto for which he had written a cadenza soon after his arrival in Vienna. </li>
       <li><strong>1802</strong> -He dedicated his Sonata Op. 27 No. 2, now commonly known as the Moonlight Sonata, to Julie Guicciardi.</li>
       <li><strong>1802</strong> - On the advice of his doctor, Beethoven moved to the small Austrian town of Heiligenstadt, just outside Vienna, in an attempt to come to terms with his declining hearing loss.</li>
       <li><strong>1804-1808</strong> - Beethoven writes his most famous Symphony; the 5th symphony</li>
       <li><strong>1815</strong> - Beethoven goes deaf</li>
       <li><strong>1815-1819</strong> - Beethoven's output dropped again to a level unique in his mature life. He attributed part of this to a lengthy illness (he called it an inflammatory fever) that he had for more than a year, starting in October 1816.</li>
       <li><strong>1823</strong> - Beethoven completed three notable works, all of which had occupied Beethoven for some years, namely the Missa solemnis, the Ninth Symphony and the Diabelli Variations.</li>
       <li><strong>1827</strong> - Beethoven died on 26 March 1827 at the age of 56</li>
     </ul>
